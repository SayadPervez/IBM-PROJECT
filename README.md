# IBM-PROJECT
## IBM IOT BASED TRAFFIC SIGNS BILLBOARD PROJECT

### Milestones :
1. Hardware research and Socket Communication - Sayad Pervez
2. Image to Map algorithm developement - Ulagaraja
3. Open Weather API python program - Yuvashri
4. Speed calculation w.r.t weather research - Yuvashri
5. Optimum LED Display market research - Yuvashri
6. Fog / Visibility measurement using AI/ML - Yuvashree

### Task Submission Schema

> Python is the preferred programming language except for (Ulagaraja) web development and algorithm development

> Each task must be submitted as a single file python program. In case of ML/AI based assignment (Yuvashri and Yuvashree) The entire task must be submitted as 2 files atmost. One **`.py`** file [strictly no **`.ipynb (jupyter notebook files)`**]. One file for the trained model of any type.

> Program file structure must be as below

```
#all library imports
import a,b,c

# subfunctions
def subfunction1():
  return(blah)
  
def subfunction2():
  return(blahblah)
  
def subfunction3():
  return(blahblahblah)

# a main function named run must be madatory in the file you submit
def run(input1, input2):
  subfunction1()
  subfunction2()
  subfunction3()
  return( result )
  
# comments section explaining what the input variables of run function are and their data types
# #input1 is the latitude ,datatype is string
# #input2 is the longtitude ,datatype is float

# comments section explaining what the output variables of run function are and their data types
# #result is the weather condition at the given latitude and longtitude, datatype is list os floats

```
