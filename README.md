# IBM-PROJECT
## IBM IOT BASED TRAFFIC SIGNS BILLBOARD PROJECT

### Project Summary :
A digital LED display based traffic sign will be attached at every road junction. Depending on the weather, visibility, rain, stagnant water, quality of road and traffic conditions, the sign changes the recommended speed limit, redirects traffic and allows emergency vehicles to pass through without delay.

### Milestones :
- **Open Weather API** 
- **Location API -> IP/Manual based**
- **Speed Prediction**
- **Optimum Display Procurement**
- **Rain Measurement -> Image/Sensor based**
- **Fog/Visibility Measurement -> Image based AI/ML**
- **Dashboard, GUI and remote server control**
- **Image Transmission**
- **Programming the LED Display**
- **Hardware & Software Integration**

### Optional Milestones :
- **Route planning -> Image based/ Manual/ Google maps API**
- **Intelligent Path processing**
- **Road Quality Measurement**
- **Emergency Vehicle Assistance**

### Task Submission Schema

> Python is the preferred programming language except for (Ulagaraja) web development and algorithm development

> Each task must be submitted as a single file python program. In case of ML/AI based assignment (Yuvashri and Yuvashree) The entire task must be submitted as 2 files atmost. One **`.py`** file [strictly no **`.ipynb (jupyter notebook files)`**]. One file for the trained model of any type.

> Program file structure must be as below

```
#all library imports
import a,b,c

# subfunctions
def subfunction1():
  return(blah)
  
def subfunction2():
  return(blahblah)
  
def subfunction3():
  return(blahblahblah)

# a main function named run must be madatory in the file you submit
def run(input1, input2):
  subfunction1()
  subfunction2()
  subfunction3()
  return( result )
  
# comments section explaining what the input variables of run function are and their data types
# #input1 is the latitude ,datatype is string
# #input2 is the longtitude ,datatype is float

# comments section explaining what the output variables of run function are and their data types
# #result is the weather condition at the given latitude and longtitude, datatype is list os floats

```
